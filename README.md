GoScript
========
Translation compiler from Go to JavaScript.

[Documentation online](http://go.pkgdoc.org/github.com/kless/goscript)

## Installation

	go get github.com/kless/goscript

## QUESTIONS

+ Type "nil" is translated to "void 0", should be translated to "undefined"?
+ New lines "\n" are translated to `<br>`, any problem?
+ print/println are translated to "document.write", but since they are used to
  debug, would be better to translate them to "alert"?

## Status

Active | Incomplete

There are some errors in the translation.  
Code related to slices (file "jslib/lib.go") is not finished; it has to works in
JS just like in Go.
