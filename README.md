GoScript
========

Compiles transforming Go into JavaScript so you can continue using a clean and
concise sintaxis.  
In fact, it is used a subset of Go since JavaScript has not native way to
represent some types neither Go's statements, although some of them could be
emulated (but that is not my goal).

Advantages:

+ Use one only language for all development. A great advantage for a company.

+ It allows many type errors to be caught early in the development cycle, due
to static typing.

+ The mathematical expressions are calculated at the translation stage. (ToDo)

+ The lines numbers in the unminified generated JavaScript match up with the
lines numbers in the original source file. (ToDo)

+ Generate minimized JavaScript. (ToDo)

Go sintaxis not supported:

+ Complex numbers, and integers of 64 bits
+ Function and interface types excepting the empty interface
+ Channels, goroutines (ToDo)
+ Import declarations from core library (ToDo)

Status:

	const				[OK]
	itoa				[OK]
	blank identifier	[OK]
	var					[OK]
	array				[OK]
	slice				[OK]
	ellipsis			[OK]
	map					[OK]
	empty interface		[OK]
	check channel		[OK]
	struct				[OK]
	pointer				[OK]

**Note:** JavaScript can not actually do meaningful integer arithmetic on anything
bigger than 2^53. Also bitwise logical operations only have defined results (per
the spec) up to 32 bits.  
By this reason, the integers of 64 bits are unsupported, and there is to use
explicitly *int32()* or *uint32()*.
