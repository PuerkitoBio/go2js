GoScript
========

Compiles transforming Go into JavaScript so you can continue using a clean and
concise sintaxis.  
In fact, it is used a subset of Go since JavaScript has not native way to
represent some types neither Go's statements, although some of them could be
emulated (but that is not my goal).

Advantages:

+ Use one only language for all development. A great advantage for a company.

+ It allows many type errors to be caught early in the development cycle, due
to static typing.

+ The mathematical expressions are calculated at the translation stage. (ToDo)

+ The lines numbers in the unminified generated JavaScript match up with the
lines numbers in the original source file. (ToDo)

+ Generate minimized JavaScript. (ToDo)

Go sintaxis not supported:

+ Complex numbers
+ Function and interface types excepting the empty interface
+ Channels, goroutines (ToDo)
+ Import declarations from core library (ToDo)

Status:

	const				[OK]
	itoa				[OK]
	blank identifier	[OK]
	var					[OK]
	array				[OK]
	slice				[OK]
	ellipsis			[OK]
	map					[OK]
	empty interface		[OK]
	check channel		[OK]
	struct				[OK]
	check big number	[.]
	pointer				[OK]
